#Meteor DDP Client for Java  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/advantageous/ddp-client-java.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/advantageous/ddp-client-java)

**"Meteor is an open-source platform for building top-quality web apps in a fraction of the time, whether you're an expert developer or just getting started."  [-Meteor Website](https://www.meteor.com/)**

This library allows Java developers to make clients for Meteor web applications that can take advantage of [data subscriptions](http://docs.meteor.com/#publishandsubscribe) and published [RPC methods](http://docs.meteor.com/#methods_header).

##Quick Start

**Note: This project requires JDK 1.8 and Gradle.**
A backport to JDK 1.7 can be found in [this branch](https://github.com/advantageous/ddp-client-java/tree/jdk7)

* Checkout this repo
* Run the meteor app locally
```
cd examples/meteor-common
meteor
```
* Build and run a sample application
```
gradle jar
java -jar examples/simple-subscription/build/libs/simple-subscription.jar
```

* Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000
* Enjoy!

##Maven/Gradle Dependency
Release versions of this library are published to the Maven Central Repository.
If you are using Maven, add the dependency to your pom.xml
```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.advantageous.ddp</groupId>
        <artifactId>ddp-client</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
```
If you are using Gradle
```groovy
    compile 'io.advantageous.ddp:ddp-client:1.0.0'
```

##Components

This library can be described by breaking it into three main parts.

 * Common Message Components
 * Subscription Adapters
 * RPC Client

The package structure represents this grouping as well.

###DDPMessageEndpoint
The message endpont is the websocket endpoint for all the DDP messages.  The endpoint is responsible for handling the
connection to the Meteor server and dispatching DDP messages to listeners.  Listeners are registered with the
registerHandler method.

The constructor takes two arguments: a javax.websocket.WebsocketContainer, and a MessageConverter.

```java
    DDPMessageEndpoint endpoint = new DDPMessageEndpointImpl(webSocketContainer, messageConverter);

    endpoint.registerHandler(ConnectedMessage.class, message ->
            System.out.println("connected to server! session: " + message.getSession()));
```

###MessageConverter
The message converter is what converts a DDP message into a strongly typed Java message object.  The only included
implementation is a JSONMessageConverter because the Meteor server uses JSON over websocket by default.  The reason this
was abstracted out of the main client is because one could potentially use another serialization strategy here.
(Google's Protocol Buffers, for example)

###SubscriptionAdapter
A subscription adapter is responsible for subscribing and unsubscribing from collections and handling subscription
messages.  This library includes a MapSubscription adapter that updates a java.util.Map from subscription messages.  The
map is injected into the MapSubscriptionAdapter so that you can use a simple HashMap or any map provider. (Memcached,
JGroups, etc.)

You can also extend the BaseSubscriptionAdapter to use any other local storage.  (minimongo anyone?)

```java
    Map<String, Map<String, Object>> dataMap = new HashMap<>();

    SubscriptionAdapter adapter = new MapSubscriptionAdapter(
            endpoint,
            new JsonObjectConverter(),
            dataMap
    );

    // Subscribe to a collection when a connection is established
    endpoint.registerHandler(ConnectedMessage.class, message -> {
        try {
            adapter.subscribe(new Subscription("employees", Employee.class));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(e);
        }
    });

```

###ObjectConverter
The object convert is what converts Added and Changed DDP messages into their mapped Java objects.  The only included
converter is a JSON converter, but an EJSON converter would be handy in the future.

###RPCClient
The RPC client is used to call Meteor.method functions.  The call method requires callbacks for success and failure.
